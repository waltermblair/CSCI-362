# Team TBD

Team TBD's repository is amazing! Here's a quick tour:  

TestAutomation/  
  Contains our Automated Testing Framework. Navigate to TestAutomation and run script/runAllTests.sh to execute the framework.  
  
concept/
  A concept script and driver for compiling individual Pidgin components with dependencies and calling specific methods from command-line. We left Pidgin behind, but it's nice to admire our work!
  
matthew/ nicholas/ walter/
  Personal directories we kept just to decrease our stress levels in case we ever went awry with Git.
  
miscellaneous files
  We have uploaded our deliverables and final report, final poster, and final presentation. We also still have our first deliverable's script for listing directory contents in a browser to remind us how far we've come!
